# TASK 1 - EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

## Introduction
Spam emails are not only annoying but also time-consuming and potentially dangerous. This project aims to address the issue of spam emails by building an email spam detector using Python. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we train the spam detector to accurately classify emails as either spam or non-spam.

## Features
- Utilizes Python for building the email spam detector.
- Applies machine learning algorithms for training and classification.
- Implements label encoding to transform categorical data.
- Uses Logistic Regression for the classification task.
- Allows for custom prediction inputs.

## Installation
To run the email spam detector, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:
('''pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn''')

## Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps include:

- Loading the dataset.
- Cleaning and preparing the data.
- Transforming categorical data using label encoding.

## Model Training
The model training involves:

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Training a Logistic Regression model.
Evaluating the model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Custom Predictions
The project allows for custom input predictions. You can input your own email text to classify it as spam or non-spam.

## Conclusion
The Email Spam Detection project addresses the pervasive issue of spam emails through the development of a robust machine learning solution. By leveraging Python and popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn, I have constructed an efficient spam detection system.

This project serves as a testament to the potential of machine learning in addressing everyday challenges. By continuing to refine and improve such solutions, we can create safer and more efficient digital environments for all users.

I invite you to explore the project, contribute to its development, and join us in the ongoing mission to combat spam and enhance online security. Together, we can build a safer digital future.
